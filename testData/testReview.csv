5.0	hi Several GREAT novellas in one very long book!	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I won't go into the plot since everyone will know it.
3.0	hello	Some great scenes and lines that don't add up	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">It's been a long time since I found a book so alternately beautiful and maddening.
3.0	hi/again	A stunning success, one of the most striking novels I have read in years	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">I passed the Metropolitan Museum of Art the other day and was struck with a powerful and initially inexplicable melancholy.
3.0	hello/again	I. Don't. Get. It.	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This book has been highly praised and won the Pulitzer Prize, and I just don't get it.
5.0	hi/again2	Superficial, shallow, boring and inconsistent	"<span class=""a-size-base review-text"">This was easily the most overrated book of 2013.
